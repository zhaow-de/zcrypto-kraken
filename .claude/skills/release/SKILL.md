Cuts a release PR from `develop` to `main`, then pushes the `v<version>` tag and creates the GitHub Release directly from this skill. After the release is published, the skill back-merges `main` into `develop` to keep them in lock-step.

## Context

- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Current version: !`cz version --project`
- Prerequisites: !`which cz && which gh && which python3 && which uv && echo "all found" || echo "MISSING tools"`

## Instructions

1. **Verify prerequisites** from the context above. If not on `develop`, ask the user to switch branches first. If any tool is missing (`cz`, `gh`, `python3`, `uv`), report and stop. `cz` is installed with `uv tool install commitizen` (or your platform's package manager). Confirm `gh auth status` succeeds — if it returns 401, ask the user to run `gh auth refresh -h github.com` first.

2. **Update develop and verify it is synced with main**:
   ```bash
   git pull origin develop
   git fetch origin main
   ```

   Check for drift — if `main` has commits not on `develop`, a release or hotfix landed on `main` without being back-merged. Releasing now would re-introduce conflicts (version files, `CHANGELOG.md`, files modified-on-main but deleted-on-develop).

   ```bash
   git log develop..origin/main --oneline
   ```

   If this shows any commits, drift exists. Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask whether to resolve it now by merging `main` into `develop`, or to abort:
   - Show the drifting commits (so the user can see what's about to come in).
   - Options: "Yes, back-merge main → develop now" / "Abort, I'll handle it manually".

   **If the user chooses to back-merge:**
   ```bash
   git merge origin/main --no-edit
   ```

   - If the merge succeeds cleanly: `develop` is PR-protected (no direct pushes — the same fact step 17 is built on), so land it exactly as step 17 lands the back-merge — a short `chore/pre-release-sync-v<VERSION>` branch, PR, poll-then-merge. Then continue to step 3.
   - If the merge fails with conflicts, do **not** push. Investigate each conflicted file, propose a resolution to the user (typical patterns: version files → take whichever is newer / about-to-be-bumped; `CHANGELOG.md` → keep both entries chronologically; modified-on-main but deleted-on-develop → confirm the fix exists in the replacement code, then keep the deletion), apply it, commit the merge, and land it via the same PR route. Only then continue.

   **If the user chooses to abort:** stop and report — do not proceed.

3. **Create the release branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b "release/$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
   ```

4. **Bump the version files and generate the raw changelog** — `--files-only`, so nothing is committed or tagged yet:
   ```bash
   cz bump --yes --changelog --files-only
   ```

   This updates the `version_files` (`pyproject.toml` and the README `Version` badge), bumps `.cz.toml`, and writes the raw commit list to `CHANGELOG.md`. With `--files-only` it does **not** commit or tag — the skill makes one commit and creates the `v<version>` tag in step 9, after the changelog is rewritten (step 8) and `uv.lock` is refreshed (step 5).

   > Prerequisite: commitizen must be configured — this repo's `.cz.toml` sets `version_files` for `pyproject.toml` and the README `Version` badge. Set it up before running `/release` if missing.

5. **Refresh `uv.lock` to record the new version**:
   ```bash
   uv lock
   ```
   `cz bump` does not touch `uv.lock`; without this step the lockfile would silently drift behind `pyproject.toml`. The change is uncommitted at this point; step 9 commits it together with the version bump and changelog.

6. **Verify `version_files` were actually bumped**:

   `cz bump` silently skips a `version_files` entry whose line no longer contains the previous version string (drift from a past bad bump). A silent skip means `pyproject.toml` or the README `Version` badge would keep the old version.

   ```bash
   NEW_VERSION=$(cz version --project)
   PYPROJECT_VERSION=$(grep -E '^version' pyproject.toml | head -1 | sed -E 's/.*"([^"]+)".*/\1/')
   README_VERSION=$(grep -oE 'badge/version-v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+' README.md | head -1 | sed -E 's/.*-v//')

   if [ "$PYPROJECT_VERSION" != "$NEW_VERSION" ] || [ "$README_VERSION" != "$NEW_VERSION" ]; then
       echo "ERROR: cz bump skipped one or more version_files"
       echo "  cz says: $NEW_VERSION"
       echo "  pyproject.toml: $PYPROJECT_VERSION"
       echo "  README.md badge: $README_VERSION"
       echo "Stop and investigate — do NOT push. Likely cause: the file's version drifted from .cz.toml in a past release, so cz's find-and-replace cannot locate the old value."
       exit 1
   fi
   ```

   If this fails, stop and report — do not proceed.

7. **Fetch PR data for the changelog**:
   ```bash
   python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/fetch-pr-data.py ${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}
   ```

8. **Generate the user-friendly changelog**:

   Read the PR data from `/tmp/release_pr_data_${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}.json` and follow the format and guidelines in [changelog-format.md](changelog-format.md). Replace the raw commit list `cz bump` wrote into `CHANGELOG.md` with the user-friendly section for the new version at the top, and **preserve all previous version sections below it**.

   This new-version section is also the GitHub Release description: step 16 extracts it back out **from the tag** (`git show v<VERSION>:CHANGELOG.md`) when publishing, so it never needs to live in the repo as a separate file.

9. **Commit the release and create the tag**:
   ```bash
   VERSION=$(cz version --project)
   git add .cz.toml pyproject.toml README.md CHANGELOG.md uv.lock
   git commit -m "chore(release): bump version to v$VERSION"
   git tag "v$VERSION"
   ```

   One commit carries the version bump, changelog, and refreshed lockfile; the `v<version>` tag points at it. Remember `VERSION` for the remaining steps.

10. **Push the release branch**:
    ```bash
    git push origin "$(git branch --show-current)"
    ```

11. **Create the PR** with `gh pr create` targeting `main`, using the description template from [pr-description.md](pr-description.md) (fill in `{version}` with `VERSION`). Include flags `--base main`, `--title "Release v<VERSION>"`, `--assignee @me`, and pass the filled template via `--body-file` (or `--body`).

12. **Store the PR number and URL** from the output of step 11. The PR URL ends in the number (e.g. `.../pull/63` means PR number `63`).

13. **Return to develop**:
    ```bash
    git checkout develop
    ```

14. **Auto-merge the release PR** with a merge commit (preserving the tagged bump commit on `main`). The skill no longer pauses to ask the user — releases run end-to-end. Stop only if something is genuinely worth attention: the PR has conflicts, or it was closed without merging. Otherwise poll every 30 seconds and merge as soon as GitHub reports the PR mergeable and not blocked by branch protection:
    ```bash
    PR_NUMBER=<the PR number from step 12>

    while true; do
        pr_state=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json state -q .state)
        pr_mergeable=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json mergeable -q .mergeable)
        pr_state_status=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json mergeStateStatus -q .mergeStateStatus)
        if [ "$pr_state" = "MERGED" ]; then
            echo "PR merged!"
            break
        elif [ "$pr_state" = "CLOSED" ]; then
            echo "PR was closed without merging — stop"
            exit 1
        elif [ "$pr_mergeable" = "CONFLICTING" ]; then
            echo "PR has conflicts — stop, do not merge"
            exit 1
        elif [ "$pr_mergeable" = "MERGEABLE" ] && [ "$pr_state_status" != "BLOCKED" ]; then
            gh pr merge "$PR_NUMBER" --merge --delete-branch && break
        fi
        echo "Waiting for PR to be ready... (state: $pr_state, mergeable: $pr_mergeable, status: $pr_state_status)"
        sleep 30
    done
    ```

15. **Push the release tag** so it points at the bump commit now on `main`. The tag was created in step 9 and persists across the branch switch.
    ```bash
    git push origin "v<VERSION>"
    ```

16. **Create the GitHub Release** directly, with the new version's changelog section as the description. Extract that section **from the tag** (`git show v<VERSION>:CHANGELOG.md`), *not* the working-tree `CHANGELOG.md`: by this point you are back on `develop` (step 13), whose `CHANGELOG.md` does not yet carry the new section (it arrives only via the back-merge in step 17), so reading the working tree would publish **empty** notes.
    ```bash
    git show "v<VERSION>:CHANGELOG.md" | awk 'NR>1 && /^## v[0-9]/{exit} {print}' > "/tmp/release_notes_v<VERSION>.md"
    if [ ! -s "/tmp/release_notes_v<VERSION>.md" ]; then
        echo "ERROR: extracted release notes are empty — do NOT publish. Check the tag's CHANGELOG.md."
        exit 1
    fi
    gh release create "v<VERSION>" --title "v<VERSION>" --notes-file "/tmp/release_notes_v<VERSION>.md" --verify-tag
    ```
    The `awk` prints from the top of the tagged `CHANGELOG.md` until the next `## v…` header — i.e. just the new version's section. `--verify-tag` aborts if the tag was not pushed in step 15. The command prints the Release URL — keep it for the final report.

17. **Back-merge `main` → `develop` via a PR.** This repo's `develop` is protected against direct pushes, so the back-merge cannot be a plain `git push`. Cut a dedicated `chore/back-merge-v<VERSION>` branch off `origin/main` (using `main` itself as the PR head works in GitHub but is awkward — a topic branch keeps the PR's head distinct from the long-lived ref and gives us something straightforward to delete locally in step 18). Push it, open the PR, then auto-merge with the same poll-then-merge loop as step 14:
    ```bash
    git fetch origin main
    BACKMERGE_BRANCH="chore/back-merge-v<VERSION>"
    git checkout -b "$BACKMERGE_BRANCH" origin/main
    git push -u origin "$BACKMERGE_BRANCH"
    BACKMERGE_URL=$(gh pr create --base develop --head "$BACKMERGE_BRANCH" \
        --title "chore(config): back-merge v<VERSION> into develop" \
        --body "Back-merge of the \`v<VERSION>\` release commit from \`main\` into \`develop\` so the two branches stay in lock-step per \`.claude/rules/branch-workflow.md\`. Auto-opened by the \`/release\` skill.")
    BACKMERGE_NUMBER=$(echo "$BACKMERGE_URL" | sed -E 's|.*/pull/([0-9]+)|\1|')

    while true; do
        pr_state=$(gh pr view "$BACKMERGE_NUMBER" --json state -q .state)
        pr_mergeable=$(gh pr view "$BACKMERGE_NUMBER" --json mergeable -q .mergeable)
        pr_state_status=$(gh pr view "$BACKMERGE_NUMBER" --json mergeStateStatus -q .mergeStateStatus)
        if [ "$pr_state" = "MERGED" ]; then
            echo "Back-merge PR merged!"
            break
        elif [ "$pr_state" = "CLOSED" ]; then
            echo "Back-merge PR was closed without merging — stop"
            exit 1
        elif [ "$pr_mergeable" = "CONFLICTING" ]; then
            echo "Back-merge PR has conflicts — stop, do not merge"
            exit 1
        elif [ "$pr_mergeable" = "MERGEABLE" ] && [ "$pr_state_status" != "BLOCKED" ]; then
            gh pr merge "$BACKMERGE_NUMBER" --merge --delete-branch && break
        fi
        echo "Waiting for back-merge PR... (state: $pr_state, mergeable: $pr_mergeable, status: $pr_state_status)"
        sleep 30
    done
    ```

18. **Local cleanup** — fast-forward both branches against their remotes, drop the throwaway release **and** back-merge branches, and prune stale tracking refs:
    ```bash
    git checkout develop
    git pull --ff-only origin develop
    git checkout main
    git pull --ff-only origin main
    git checkout develop
    git branch -d release/<timestamp from step 3>
    git branch -d chore/back-merge-v<VERSION>
    git fetch --all --prune
    ```

    Both `git branch -d` calls succeed because each branch is fully integrated via its merge commit (the release branch into `main` via PR step 14; the back-merge branch into `develop` via PR step 17). If either ever errors "not fully merged" while its PR shows merged and the remote head is gone, the work is integrated — `git branch -D` is then safe.

19. **Report success** with the release PR URL, the GitHub Release URL (printed by step 16), and the back-merge PR URL. The Release description is the new version's changelog section; the full history lives in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Notes

- If any step fails, stop and report the error to the user.
- The `--yes` flag on `cz bump` auto-confirms the version bump.
- Auto-merge in steps 14 and 17 uses `--merge` — never switch to `--squash` or `--rebase`, which would lose the bump-commit-tagged invariant on `main`.
- Do not use composite commands — they always force a permission request from the user.
- You are already in the repo folder — do not `cd` first (redundant, and can cause a composite command).
